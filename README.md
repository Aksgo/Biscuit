## About
Biscuit is a highly customizable code editor written completely in pure python. It uses tkinter for the GUI. Biscuit is under active development currently but it is stable for use. 

Biscuit may not be the most visually appealing code editor out there but it is powerful. It is easy to use and feature rich.
