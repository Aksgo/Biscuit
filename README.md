Biscuit is not just your ordinary text editorâ€”it's a cutting-edge powerhouse designed to revolutionize your coding experience. With its highly customizable and clutter-free user interface, Biscuit draws inspiration from the legendary <b>Visual Studio Code</b>, aiming to deliver a comparable level of capability and elegance. But here's the game-changer: Biscuit is built entirely with pure Python and the versatile Tkinter library.
