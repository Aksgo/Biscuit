The main aim of the **Biscuit project**, when it started off was to break down the complex processes behind popular code editors that power today, and develop a comparable tool that is as capable, efficient, and well-optimized as the existing ones. The current codebase of Biscuit is written in **pure Python** and draws a lot of inspiration from esteemed code editors like Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Emacs.

Our project also aims to foster a vibrant open-source community of Python enthusiasts and software developers, working together to create a truly innovative tool. With invaluable contributions from passionate collaborators, Biscuit has made significant progress in incorporating essential features such as syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and Git integration.
